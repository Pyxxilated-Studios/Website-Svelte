<h1>About</h1>

<img src="/Rilee.webp" alt="Rilee" />

<p>
	As much as I would like to claim that the picture on the left is of me, I cannot. This is my dog
	Rilee, and she helps to keep me somewhat sane during pretty much anything.
</p>

<p>
	There's not much to say about me other than what can be found around, on my
	<a href="/blog">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/pyxxil">GitHub</a>/
	<a href="https://www.gitlab.com/pyxxil">Gitlab</a>, or
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pyxxil">LinkedIn</a>. I'm just someone who enjoys solving
	problems, and programming just so happens to be the tool with which I do so.
</p>

<p>
	Generally, I haven't stuck to one singular passion within programming. I'll often swap around what
	I like to do, which may have lead me down to almost being a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None",
	however I like to think most of the stuff I have done has all lead to making me a better developer
	in some way. I've spent the past few years working on several personal projects, a few of which
	you can find amongst my <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page on this website.
</p>

<p>
	While I've spent most of my career as a Fullstack Software Developer, it's not exactly my passion.
	My passion mainly lies in optimisation, and writing efficient code. It just so happens to be
	easiest to find a job as a web developer, and working on that kind of stuff in my own time.
	However, I'm always open to hearing about jobs that would enable me to do such things (and if it
	uses a systems programming language, even better).
</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

I'm currently employed as a Software Engineer at P^werFinance, a FinTech startup in Auckland. Our
tech stack is ever changing as we figure out the best way to do things, but in general it involves
the following:

<ul>
	<li>TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend & Backend)</li>
	<li>React (Frontend)</li>
	<li>Rust</li>
	<li>Azure</li>
	<li>Bash/ZSH/Fish</li>
	<li>git</li>
	<li>Solidity (Quorum chain)</li>
</ul>

However I've also worked with, among other things, the following:
<ul>
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>Groovy</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Angular</li>
	<li>AWS</li>
	<li>BonitaSoft (Business Process Management)</li>
	<li>UiPath (Robotic Process Automation)</li>
	<li>C</li>
	<li>C++</li>
	<li>SQL (MSSql, MySQL, SQLite)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This has involved me doing Robotic Process Automation, Business Process Management, and
	optimisation of a two decade old C++ codebase. To find out a bit more, you can download my resume
	<a href="https://resume.pyxxilated.studio">here</a>.
</p>

In my own time, with the aforementioned projects, I've built up some skill with the following
technologies:

<ul>
	<li>C</li>
	<li>C++</li>
	<li>C#</li>
	<li>Debugging (gdb, lldb, rubber duck, print)</li>
	<li>HTML/CSS</li>
	<li>JavaScript/TypeScript</li>
	<li>Linux</li>
	<li>React</li>
	<li>Rust</li>
	<li>Valgrind</li>
	<li>And more &hellip;</li>
</ul>
