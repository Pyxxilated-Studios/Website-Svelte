<p>
	As much as I would like to claim that the picture on the left is of me, I cannot. This is my dog
	Rilee, and she helps to keep me somewhat sane during pretty much anything.
</p>

<p>
	There's not much to say about me other than what can be found around, on my
	<a href="/blog">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/pyxxil">GitHub</a>/
	<a href="https://www.gitlab.com/pyxxil">Gitlab</a>, or
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pyxxil">LinkedIn</a>. I'm just someone who enjoys solving
	problems, and programming just so happens to be the tool with which I do so.
</p>

<p>
	Generally, I haven't stuck to one singular passion within programming. I'll often swap around what
	I like to do, which may have lead me down to almost being a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None",
	however I like to think most of the stuff I have done has all lead to making me a better developer
	in some way. I've spent the past few years working on several personal projects, a few of which
	you can find amongst my <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page on this website.

<h2>Experience</h2>

I'm currently employed as a Fullstack Developer at P^werFinance, a FinTech startup in Auckland. Our
tech stack is ever changing as we figure out the best way to do things, but in general it involves
the following:

<ul>
	<li class="about-item">TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend/Backend)</li>
	<li class="about-item">React (Frontend)</li>
	<li class="about-item">Rust</li>
	<li class="about-item">Azure</li>
	<li class="about-item">Bash/ZSH/Fish</li>
	<li class="about-item">git</li>
	<li class="about-item">Blockchain</li>
</ul>

However I've also worked with, among other things, the following:
<ul>
	<li class="about-item">Java</li>
	<li class="about-item">Groovy</li>
	<li class="about-item">Python</li>
	<li class="about-item">Angular</li>
	<li class="about-item">AWS</li>
	<li class="about-item">BonitaSoft (Business Process Management)</li>
	<li class="about-item">UiPath (Robotic Process Automation)</li>
	<li class="about-item">C</li>
	<li class="about-item">C++</li>
	<li class="about-item">SQL (MSSql, MySQL, SQLite)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This has involved me doing Robotic Process Automation, Business Process Management, and
	optimisation of a two decade old C++ codebase. Perhaps I should just provide a link to my resume
	here &hellip;
</p>

In my own time, with the aforementioned projects, I've built up some skill with the following
technologies:
<ul>
	<li class="about-item">C</li>
	<li class="about-item">C++</li>
	<li class="about-item">C#</li>
	<li class="about-item">Debugging (gdb, lldb, rubber duck, print)</li>
	<li class="about-item">HTML/CSS</li>
	<li class="about-item">JavaScript/TypeScript</li>
	<li class="about-item">Linux</li>
	<li class="about-item">React</li>
	<li class="about-item">Rust</li>
	<li class="about-item">Valgrind</li>
	<li class="about-item">And more &hellip;</li>
</ul>
